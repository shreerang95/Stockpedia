"Apple: Taiwan Media May Be Mistaking iPhone 8 for X, Says Rosenblatt,Speculation about Apple (AAPL) cutting component orders for the iPhone X because of flagging sales may be just a misunderstanding, according to a report this morning from Jun Zhang of Rosenblatt Securities.  Zhang, who has a Buy rating on Apple shares, and a $180 price target, writes that his own research — he does not cite specific sources — “indicates no further order cuts after the holiday season. Zhang is modeling iPhone production in the March quarter of 35 million, which is about the same as was mentioned in the report from Sinolink cited by Bloomberg, and higher than the 25 million cited by JL Warren Capital.  Zhang writes that the recent estimate adjustments could be attributed to previously very bullish views on the iPhone X cycle. He also thinks the folks looking at matter, particularly folks at the Taiwanese paper Economic Daily, which was mentioned by Reuters, “could be confusing the market as we believe they are referring to previously mentioned iPhone 8/8 Plus production cuts. “We previously wrote about iPhone 8/8 Plus production/component order cuts,” relates Zhang."\
